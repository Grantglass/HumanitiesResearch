# Research in the Humanities

Research in the humanities is often misunderstood and mischaracterized. Traditionally, when we think of research, we see a laboratory with scientists in lab-coats hunched over microscopes. Because research in the humanities is often a solitary activity, done in dark corners of the library or within one's own mind, it can be difficult for us to gain a sense of what research looks like in English. Rather than seeing research to produce findings, research in English is a process that oftentimes generates new analyses. 


### Methods

What are the "methods" of the humanities?

```
1. The historical method is the most common of the  methodologies used in the humanities. It seeks to examine the context that produced the text and assumes there is a connection between the text, its ideology, and its historical moment. Sometimes this can be biographical, psychological, or comparative in nature.

2. A bibliographic or technocritical method focuses on the material conditions of the text in question. Its most common form exists in textual criticism, which is concerned with the analysis of a given text in its material form. 

3. A institutional method focuses on the social, economic, and political conditions that surround a text. Often times, this method more narrowly focuses on the intersections gender, race, and class within a given work. Incarnations of this analysis include: Marxism, New Historicism, and Post-Colonialsm. 

4. Hermeneutics and reception theory are similar methods that look at the behaviors and intensions of the author and readers. One can look at how meaning is constructed by different groups and individuals through studing their interpretations of the text or by studying an author's personal writings.

## Where do I go?

```
Often, the assignment or research question will shape what method you will utlize. It is extremely important to understand your research question first! Write it down and think about what sorts of method(s) you will need to answer your question.

1. A research question should start with “how,” “why,” or “what” 

2. A research question should be open-ended (i.e., not answerable with a simple “yes” or “no,” or a quick response, such as a statistic)

3. A research question should have a debatable, multi-faceted answer.

## Getting Started

The library catalogue is often the best place to start research. 

[UNC-CH](https://library.unc.edu) - UNC Libraries search

[WorldCat](https://www.worldcat.org) - World Wide search

[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) - World Wide search

## Boolean Search

Boolean searches allow you to combine words and phrases using the words AND, OR, NOT and NEAR (otherwise known as Boolean operators) to limit, widen, or define your search. 

## Boolean Search Operators

```
The Boolean search operator AND is equal to the "+" symbol.
The Boolean search operator NOT is equal to the "-" symbol.
The Boolean search operator OR is the default setting of any search engine; meaning, all search engines will return all the words you type in, automatically.
The Boolean search operator NEAR is equal to putting a search query in quotes, i.e., "sponge bob squarepants". You're essentially telling the search engine that you want all of these words, in this specific order or this specific phrase.
```

Be aware:  In many, but not all, databases, the AND is implied. 
For example, Google automatically puts an AND in between your search terms.

Though all your search terms are included in the results, they may not be connected together in the way you want.
For example, this search:  college students test anxiety  is translated to:  college AND students AND test AND anxiety. The words may appear individually throughout the resulting records.

You can search using phrases to make your results more specific.
For example:  "college students" AND "test anxiety". This way, the phrases show up in the results as you expect them to be.



## Boolean Basic Math - Can Help With Your Search

The minus symbol:
Use the "-" symbol when you want a search engine to find pages that have one search word on them, but you need the search engine to exclude other words commonly associated with that search word. For example:

Irish -Yeats
You are telling the search engines that you would like to find pages that only have the words "Irish", but exclude the listings that include information about "Yeats". This is a fast and easy way to eliminate extra information and narrow your search down; plus you can do a string of excluded words, like this: irish -poets -"W. B. Yeats".

The plus symbol:
Now that you know how to eliminate search terms, here's how you can add them in, using the "+" symbol. For example, if you have terms that must be returned in all your search results, you can place the plus symbol in front of the terms that you need to be included, such as:

Irish+Yeats
Your search results would now have both these terms included.

### Key terms

Citations: Citations appear in the text of your composition to show where you are using source material. They will follow a specific set of established conventions. 

Primary and Secondary Sources: Primary sources are original sources, and secondary sources interpret primary sources or other information.  Both types of  sources can support your ideas.

Scholarly vs. Popular Sources: Scholarly sources speak to specialized or academic audiences while the audiences for popular sources typically have much less experience with the topic.

Intellectual Property: When we acknowledge that producers of original works deserve credit for their creation, we honor their intellectual property. 

Academic Integrity: Academic integrity stems from honesty, care, and attention to detail-- foundations of ethical research.
Plagiarism: Committing plagiarism, which is failing to give credit for work that is not your own, can have embarrassing or career-damaging consequences.



### Activity

Come up with some keywords about your topic:"Irish Independence"

What background information do I need to find to better understand my topic? 
What are the key terms that writers use when addressing this topic?
What central claim(s) might I want to make?  What are the issues or controversies inherent in these claims?


Complete the following tasks, then answer the reflection questions.
1. Brainstorm and jot down a list of keywords related to your topic Choose one of the keywords and use it in a search on Google
2. Use the same keyword in a “TX All Text” search on Academic Search Premier (library.unc.edu > E-Research by Discipline > Academic Search Premier
3. Within these search results, use the “Subject: Thesaurus” and “Subject” options under “Refine Results” to further narrow your search

Reflection questions:

1. What are the key differences between the results returned in these searches? Which yielded more results? Which yielded results more relevant to your topic?
2. Based on the list search results from Google, what will be the next steps in your research plan? How will you refine your topic?
3. Click on an entry from among the Academic Search Premier search results.  What did you learn about the source from this page?  How do the keywords listed there compare to the keywords you generated in Step 1 above?
